🛒 Dynamic Pricing Model for E-Commerce (Reinforcement Learning)
This project implements a Q-Learning based dynamic pricing engine for e-commerce platforms.
The model learns to optimize product prices in real-time based on simulated demand, seasonality, and pricing strategies.

Key Features
📊 Q-Learning Agent to learn optimal pricing strategies

🔄 Real-time Price Adjustment based on month & demand

🎯 Maximize Revenue while staying competitive

🖥️ Streamlit Dashboard for interactive simulation

📦 Multi-Product Support with independent pricing agents

Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy

Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)

How It Works
State → Current month (seasonality factor)

Action → Adjust price by ±5% or ±10%

Reward → Revenue from simulated demand

Learning → Agent updates pricing strategy over time
